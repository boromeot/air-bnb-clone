We've specialized in Tiny Homes for years but this year we decided to add one 16 feet up in a tree! Our hundred year old cottonwood tree died last year and we just couldn't cut it down. So, what did we do? We preserved the trunk and built us a treehouse to share with everyone. We are also one of the only approved \"Airbnb Experience\" hosts in all of Utah",
